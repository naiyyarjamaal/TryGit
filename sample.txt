#Different Types of Web Scrapers
Web Scrapers can be divided on the basis of many different criteria, including Self-built or Pre-built Web Scrapers, Browser extension or Software Web Scrapers, and Cloud or Local Web Scrapers.

You can have Self-built Web Scrapers but that requires advanced knowledge of programming. And if you want more features in your Web Scraper, then you need even more knowledge. On the other hand, pre-built Web Scrapers are previously created scrapers that you can download and run easily. These also have more advanced options that you can customize.

Browser extensions Web Scrapers are extensions that can be added to your browser. These are easy to run as they are integrated with your browser, but at the same time, they are also limited because of this. Any advanced features that are outside the scope of your browser are impossible to run on Browser extension Web Scrapers. But Software Web Scrapers donâ€™t have these limitations as they can be downloaded and installed on your computer. These are more complex than Browser web scrapers, but they also have advanced features that are not limited by the scope of your browser.

Cloud Web Scrapers run on the cloud, which is an off-site server mostly provided by the company that you buy the scraper from. These allow your computer to focus on other tasks as the computer resources are not required to scrape data from websites. Local Web Scrapers, on the other hand, run on your computer using local resources. So, if the Web scrapers require more CPU or RAM, then your computer will become slow and not be able to perform other tasks.
